Her impish wit, unknown to many, could be deployed unexpectedly, always to perfect effect. Ms. Harris was a master of her craft. A fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, she played a central role in many of the most important federal criminal cases of the last 40 years. Always a leader, she became the first woman Executive Assistant in the US Attorneys Office, and served two stints in the Department of Justice, first as Chief of the Frauds Section and again in 1993 when President Clinton nominated Ms. Harris to be the first woman to head the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. For her exemplary service, Ms. Harris was awarded the Department of Justice Henry Peterson award, named for a legendary career attorney who presided over the Criminal Division during the turbulent Watergate years, protecting its integrity against political forces. As a testament to her reputation for incorruptibility and fairness, she was tapped by two separate Independent Counsels to conduct investigations in the early 1990s, Ms. Harris served as Associate Independent Counsel to Hon. Arlin Adams in his investigation of corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, in 2002, by Independent Counsel Robert Ray to investigate allegations of professional misconduct stemming from prosecutors' confrontation and interview of Monica Lewinsky. In addition to her extraordinary public service accomplishments, Ms. Harris was a master teacher and mentor.
