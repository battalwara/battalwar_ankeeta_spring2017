The Board of Trustees, Volunteers, and Staff of Brooklyn Botanic Garden are deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed Board Chair Emeritus, Lois Carswell. Lois began her decades-long career at BBG as a volunteer in the Auxiliary. Elected a BBG Trustee in 1985, Lois co-chaired the Conservatory Campaign, chaired and served on numerous important Board Committees, and chaired the Board of Trustees from 1989-98. For more than 40 years, she co-chaired the Garden's annual Plant Sale with her good friend and fellow Trustee Lucille Plotz. Among the many highlights of her service as Chair, Lois hosted then-current President Bill Clinton on a visit to the Garden. In recognition of her service, one of BBG's famed yellow magnolia hybrids was named for her, and today the lemon-yellow flowers of Magnolia \"Lois\" adorn spring gardens throughout Brooklyn and beyond. Lois was a legend in Albany having founded the statewide Coalition of Living Museums in 1980 and serving as its chair ever since; during her extraordinary leadership the CLM has brought hundreds of millions of dollars of support to operate Zoos, Botanical Gardens, Aquaria and other living museums across New York State. Lois' tremendous passion, vision, and accomplishments inspired all who knew her. She created a wide circle of friends and colleagues as part of her legacy at the Garden and will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her children Anne, Alex, and Bob, and to her entire family.
