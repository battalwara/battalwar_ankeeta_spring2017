The Robert B. Fiske, Jr. Association and the John S. Martin, Jr. Association mourn the passing of their beloved colleague, Jo Ann Harris. Ms. Harris epitomized the ideals of a generation of Assistant United States Attorneys, with her impeccable judgment, wise counsel, and generosity of soul. Her impish wit, unknown to many, could be deployed unexpectedly, always to perfect effect. Ms. Harris was a master of her craft. A fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, she played a central role in many of the most important federal criminal cases of the last 40 years. Always a leader, she became the first woman Executive Assistant in the US Attorneys Office, and served two stints in the Department of Justice, first as Chief of the Frauds Section and again in 1993 when President Clinton nominated Ms. Harris to be the first woman to head the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. For her exemplary service, Ms. Harris was awarded the Department of Justice Henry Peterson award, named for a legendary career attorney who presided over the Criminal Division during the turbulent Watergate years, protecting its integrity against political forces. As a testament to her reputation for incorruptibility and fairness, she was tapped by two separate Independent Counsels to conduct investigations in the early 1990s, Ms. Harris served as Associate Independent Counsel to Hon. Arlin Adams in his investigation of corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, in 2002, by Independent Counsel Robert Ray to investigate allegations of professional misconduct stemming from prosecutors' confrontation and interview of Monica Lewinsky. In addition to her extraordinary public service accomplishments, Ms. Harris was a master teacher and mentor. A member of the faculty at Pace University School of Law and the National Institute of Trial Advocacy, she was awarded NITA's prestigious Faculty Award. In the last two decades, she played a pivotal role in creating a tribal advocacy program for Native American tribal courts and chaired the Board for the Center for the Study of First Americans. In recent years, Ms. Harris devoted time to rock art in Siberia and digs at prehistoric flint mines in Montana and Wyoming. She was devoted to Shumla, a non-profit archeological research and educational center for Lower Pecos rock art in Comstock, Texas and served as a dedicated Vice President of its Board. We offer our condolences to her brother, Richard Murray, her stepdaughter, Liz Harris, her stepson, David Harris and her four grandchildren, who were the joy of her life. 1/3", "_id": "5469744038f0d8317bec11b3", "slideshow_credits": null, "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2DD113AF93AA35752C1A9629D8B63", "byline": null, "document_type": "article", "snippet": "HARRIS--Jo Ann.
