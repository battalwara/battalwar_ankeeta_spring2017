While attending Brooklyn College, World War II began. He was drafted into the U.S. Navy and spent the next three years dropping depth charges in the Gulf of Mexico. Joe supplemented his education during the War with USAFI courses at Ohio State University, and graduating from Brooklyn College at the conclusion of his service. While working full-time, delivering news papers, selling magazines and clerking in food stores, the young Mazur advanced to the job of Political and Educational Director for Local 22 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. These jobs were necessary to support his wife Helen and his two kids while he was obtaining his law degree from New York Law School. After graduating, he established the law firm of Mazur, Dontzin, Mazur and Dewitt, and shortly thereafter, became Counsel to the New York City Department of Labor, under Mayor Lindsey. Then he became Counsel to the New York State Department of Labor, first under Governor Harriman and then Governor Rockefeller. Mayor Lindsey appointed him to the Criminal Bench in 1965, where he was reappointed two more times under Mayor Koch.
