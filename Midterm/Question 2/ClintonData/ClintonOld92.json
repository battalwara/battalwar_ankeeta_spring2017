The cause was congestive heart failure, complicated by pneumonia. Always proud of his graduation from DeWitt Clinton High School, Eugene attended Columbia College, where he was coxswain and Phi Beta Kappa. He went on to Columbia Law School, from which he graduated in 1935 as a James Kent Scholar. Gene practiced law for just shy of 80 years, with a brief interruption for military service during World War II. On September 17, 2014, he forthrightly announced his retirement from the law firm of Phillips Nizer LLP, where he had practiced since 1943. He was the consummate lawyers' lawyer, frequently consulted by colleagues seeking technical advice about knotty legal issues. His dedication to the law was leavened by a lifelong love of jazz, art, the ballet, and the New York Football Giants. Gene was beloved as well as respected. He was married for 70 years to the artist Harriet Kline, who died in 2010. Though predeceased by his son Robert, Gene is survived by his granddaughter Lisa and by Robert's widow, Georgann Kline Ohsman.
