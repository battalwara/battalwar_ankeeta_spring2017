While working full-time, delivering news papers, selling magazines and clerking in food stores, the young Mazur advanced to the job of Political and Educational Director for Local 22 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. These jobs were necessary to support his wife Helen and his two kids while he was obtaining his law degree from New York Law School.
