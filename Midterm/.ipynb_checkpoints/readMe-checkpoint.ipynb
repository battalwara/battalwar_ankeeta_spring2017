    "     2. Top 10 email addresses sending the most emails\n",

    "- From the top 10 receivers of mails (to_email_list), we can see that the top most person to receive emails is Richard Shapiro. He was the Senior Vice President and lobbyist for Enron. A lobbyist is the person who takes part in an organized attempt to influence legislators. In simpler terms, he/she pays bribes to the government to mend laws etc. He was convicted for fraud during the trials by the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second top most person to receive mails was Jeff Dasovich, who was the Government Relations Executive at Enron. We can think that the corporation was actively involved in maintaining relations with the U.S. government, which might have helped in keeping the fraud hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top most person to send emails was Kay Mann. On researching, I found out that she was the Assistant General Counsel and thus was one of the top officials of the legal department at Enron. She was not found guilty on any charges. This shows that not all employees were part of the fraud, only the tp officials were, even after having such a strong legal department.\n"
