# Final Submission: Pattern 1
## Data for Analysis
- I've used the Airbnb data available online for the cities Boston and Seattle
- Each folder contains the following files:
  1. listings.csv: It contains complete detailed information on every listing ID.
  2. reviews.csv: It includes unique ID for each reviewer and detailed comments.
  3. calendar.csv: It contains information on a particular date, listig ID and the price and availability for that day
- I chose this dataset to study the usage, popularity of the Airbnb app in two major cities
- Analysing this information has also provided some statistics on the number of visitors and prices in these two major U.S. cities.

## Packages used:
- Numpy and Pandas
- matplotlib and seaborn for plotting
- nltk.word_tokenize

## Analysis 1
Analysis of the 'calendar.csv' file for Boston Airbnb data for the following information:

### Conclusion:
The above graph shows us the trend of busiest days in Boston between September 2016- September 2017 based on the % availability of listings. Availability has increased drastically from Sepetember to December 2016, maybe because many hosts joined Airbnb with its increasing popularity. 

### 2. Price variations of listings across the year for data available

### Conclusion: 
The above graph shows the trend for average price of listings over the month-year data available. We can infer that as the Airbnb app got popular, the average prices have remained about the same close to 150 dollars , as compared to around 200 dollars in September 2016.
